# Team-Profile-Generator

## User Story

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## Introduction

Do you need to create a web page that lists the people in your team? Use this command-line app to generate an HTML file that's ready to use for your website!

## User input
The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

## Roster output
The project must generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:
1. Name
2. Role
3. ID
4. Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

## Installation

**Node.js v13+** is required in order to run this script.

## Usage

1. In your terminal, run the script with the command `node index.js`.
2. Enter your manager details when prompted.
3. Add additional members by selecting a role.
4. After all members have been added, your HTML will be generated in the `output/` folder.
